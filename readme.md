# NBA Message App

The project is to scrape NBA teams' information from the website and send game notification via LINE. //
Instead of checking out basketball-related apps myself everyday, the bot automatically integrates all information which I usually need, such as searching for highlight videos on YouTube. It's going to increase the efficiency of my daily life as a basketball fan.
